Unlike his past life, he now possesses a handsome face, a thick bank account, and the body of a B-Rank Hunter. His only goal: to live a popular, \"insider\" life without disrupting the original plot.\n\nHowever, reality hits during a staff dinner when he faces discrimination for graduating from a non-Hunter school—a detail that never appeared in the original novel.\n\nDisgusted by the two-faced nature of his fellow teachers, he decides he can't stay quiet if he wants to avoid being looked down upon. To secure the comfortable, popular life he desires, he begins to seek out \"hidden pieces\" of power. Even if it means altering the original story slightly, he decides he must become strong enough to protect himself.",

Now those students, with their experience of MMORPGs at their disposal, will hone their skills to protect the human kingdom of Edea.  \n  \nHowever, this isn't their story.  \n  \nOut of the five students, four of them were given the title of Hero and the fifth one the title of Innocent Bystander. He had been summoned by accident since he sat near the other four students. His name is Hiiro Okamura, an aloof bookworm with traveling and reading as his raison d'etre. Hiiro sees no reason to help the human kingdom in their offensive war with the demonkin, seeing that he isn't a Hero and that he has no real obligation to help them, and decides to leave the kingdom to go on his own adventure.  \n  \nSoon, Hiiro finds out that he has the very unique skill of Word Magic: magic that can materialize the definition of a word. As he travels more and more, he finds many uses for his Word Magic and many opportunities to find books, level up, and gain some of his own companions. Even with the outbreak of war on the horizon, Hiiro stays true to his desire to travel the new world he's in.",
